# Who to contact

A list score names one person worth a slot this week, and the signal that put them there. A title with no signal is not a list. It is a directory of names.

The build guide teaches a human. This pack teaches an agent.

## Start

If `$ARGUMENTS` is `score`, run the scorer on `gtm/list.json` and report each line. Otherwise `$ARGUMENTS` names a person, a company, or a signal, or is empty; work through the checklist below. The draft lives at `gtm/list.json`; create `gtm/` if missing.

## What you hold

Write one JSON object per person:

```json
{
  "title": "Ops lead at Northwind",
  "signal": "Posted a role for an outbound lead this week.",
  "score": "call this week"
}
```

1. `title`. The person, in the words you would use on a call sheet: role and company.
2. `signal`. One observable fact from this window that someone could check: a role posted, a stack change, a public complaint, a hiring line, a funding note. Not a persona label.
3. `score`. The slot you give them: `call this week`, `hold`, or `drop`.

## Signal or label

| Signal (passes) | Label (refused) |
| --- | --- |
| Posted a role for an outbound lead this week. | Decision maker |
| Moved their CRM from HubSpot to Salesforce last month. | ICP fit |
| Complained in a public forum about lead routing. | Target account |
| Raised a Series A and named sales hiring as the use. | VP Sales at Fabrikam (the title again) |

A signal says what they did. A label says who they are. If you cannot point to where you saw it, it is not a signal yet.

## Signals from brand-config.json

If `brand-config.json` is at the project root, read it first.

- `psp.signal_anchors` names the kinds of signal worth a slot. Look for those first. Each person's `signal` is one concrete, checkable instance of an anchor, not the anchor text itself.
- `psp.primary_pain` is "the problem you solve" in the slot rules below.
- `icp.role_targets` and `icp.exclusion_criteria`, when present, decide who belongs on the list at all. Leave excluded people off.

If `icp` is missing, say "Run `/gtm:setup` once for the whole suite." If the gtm plugin is not installed, ask only the two shared questions inline (which roles you target, who you never contact), then go on. Do not run a longer ICP interview here.

A real signal that matches no anchor is `hold` at best. If there is no `psp` block, say the psp pack produces it (`/plugin install psp@gtm-operator-skills`, then `/psp:psp`) and ask the user for the signal. Never invent anchors.

## Picking the slot

- `call this week`. The signal is fresh and points at the problem you solve.
- `hold`. The signal is real but early, indirect, or a step removed from your problem. Look again next week.
- `drop`. The signal is stale or points away from your problem. Say so and move on.

## Refusal

The scorer refuses a title-only list. A title with no signal is the refusal. It also refuses a persona label in place of a signal, a signal that repeats the title, and a score that is not one of the three slots. Each refusal prints one `- what is wrong → what to change` line, then `Next: fix the lines above and run this again.` Do what it says and return to step 2.

Do not invent a signal to get past the refusal. If you have no signal for a person, leave them off the list and tell the user.

## Banned: found is not sendable

A found email is not sendable until verify returns deliverable. Catch-all and unknown stay off the send list. This pack scores the slot; verification is a separate step.

## Checklist

Copy this list and tick it in order.

- [ ] 1. Name the person in `title`.
- [ ] 2. Write the `title`, `signal`, and `score` into `gtm/list.json` (create `gtm/` if missing).
- [ ] 3. Run `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/score.py --file gtm/list.json`.

Go back to step 2 if step 3 exits 1. Stop when it exits 0; the last line is `Next: /cold-email:cold-email`. Say it to the user.

The scorer runs from this skill's directory (`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`). Use `--stdin` to pipe the object instead of writing a file, and `--json` for one result object (`ok`, `verdict`, `reasons`, `fixes` parallel to `reasons`, `next`).

## Run

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/score.py --file ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/examples/list-good.json
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/score.py --file ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/examples/list-title.json
```

| File | Exit | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `examples/list-good.json` | 0 | Fresh signal, call this week. |
| `examples/list-hold.json` | 0 | Real but indirect signal, hold. |
| `examples/list-title.json` | 1 | A title-only list. |
| `examples/list-persona.json` | 1 | A persona label in place of a signal. |

Exit 2 means the input could not be read: missing file, not UTF-8, broken JSON, or not an object. A broken JSON does not echo the raw input.

## Works with the suite

This is step 3 of the GTM operator suite (`/plugin marketplace add cmj-hub/gtm-operator-skills`).

- **Reads:** `psp.signal_anchors`, `psp.primary_pain`, and `icp` from `brand-config.json` if present.
- **Writes:** `gtm/list.json` only. Never touches `brand-config.json`.
- **Before this:** psp (`/psp:psp`), when there is no `psp` block to say which signals count.
- **After this:** cold-email (`/cold-email:cold-email`) for a signal-anchored first touch to each `call this week` person; sales-offer (`/sales-offer:cold-offer`) when the first touch should hand over a leak instead.
- **Not this pack:** dedup or deliverability hygiene of a send list you already have is cold-email's `cold-email-list-quality`.

If a companion pack is not installed, name it and its install line (`/plugin install <name>@gtm-operator-skills`); do not do its job inline.

Python 3 standard library only. No network. No send.
